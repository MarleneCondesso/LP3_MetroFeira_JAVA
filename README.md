Project created with a GUI and various functionalities, ensuring 100% usability for the user.
The project is based on a fictional metro system in Santa Maria da Feira, consisting of four lines that intersect at a specific point.

The Client user has the following functionalities:

- Schedule trips (CRUD + Payment)
- The Administrator user has the following functionalities:

Administrative account registration
- Clients (Listing clients and their trips)

All the work presented in this repository is for educational porpuses, as well as demonstrating my approach to this course. I do not advise you to copy, the professors are very strict and have a very good algorithm for identifying code copied from a student that has already completed the course, and in case of foul play you may end up failing the curricular unit instantly. Do not cheat. 
PLUS: All projects developed for curricular units on this course may or may not have potential bugs.
